<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>This page is dedicated to my research towards a Master of Science at the University of Cape Town. I am studying in the Robotics and Agents Research lab, under Camaren Peter and Anet Potgieter.</p>
<h2>My Field</h2>
<p>My research is in the field of social-ecological modelling and monitoring. I wish to continue from the work done by Camaren Peter in his PhD, which involved developing a formal participatory framework to develop large scale social-ecological models. These are models of systems where both social, human factors and ecological factors interrelated, for the purpose of informing policy-makers. This framework (Bayesian Participatory-based Decision Analysis or BPDA) developed large scale Bayesian networks - a type of statistical model often used in machine learning, to represent the interactions of the salient variables in an environment.</p>
<h2>My Research</h2>
<p>I propose to convert these Bayesian models into real-time monitoring systems by linking them into real-time or near real-time data-sources. There are two purposes for this. Firstly, to create a system that can validate or invalidate (more importantly to invalidate) the correctness of a model, while at the same time using the real-time data to continually improve the model. Secondly, I wish to develop a system that can interrogate the decisions made based on the assumptions drawn from the model. The system will be able to codify decision assumptions, then continually check that the model still holds these assumptions and that the assumptions are born out by reality.</p>

<h2>My Outputs</h2>
<p>As well as my thesis in the process of my research I will be developing a variety of tools to aid in the creation and management of the BPDA models. I am releasing these tools under an open source license. The source code is available on GitHub.</p>

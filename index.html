<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>This page is dedicated to my research towards a Master of Science, Supervised by Dr Camaren Peter and Dr Steve Kroon at the University of Stellenbosch.</p>
<h2>My Field</h2>
<p>My research is in the field of social-ecological modelling and monitoring. I am continuing from the work done by Dr Camaren Peter in his PhD, which involved developing a formal participatory framework to develop large scale social-ecological models. These are models of systems where both social, human factors and ecological factors interrelated, for the purpose of informing policy-makers. This framework (Bayesian Participatory-based Decision Analysis or BPDA) developed large scale Bayesian networks - a type of statistical model often used in machine learning, to represent the interactions of the salient variables in an environment.</p>
<h2>My Research</h2>
<p>My research centers around how to extend these models to deal with dynamic systems that change over time. Temporality adds a vast new dimension to these types of maodels. Dealing with both dynamical systems and uncertainty has only briefly been attempted ina few areas. The obvious extension of teh previous work is to try implement Dynamic Bayesian networks and apply them to Social-Ecological problems.</p>

<h2>My Outputs</h2>
<p>As well as my thesis in the process of my research I will be developing a variety of tools to aid in the creation and management of the models. I am releasing these tools under an open source license. The source code is available on GitHub.</p>

Outline of Lit Review

* Sustainability
* Sustainability is important to decision makers
* Sustainability requires thinking in terms of a Social-Ecological System (SES)
* Dealing with SES's is an inherently transdisciplinary activity
* Dealing with SES requires a systemic view
* Transdisciplinary and systemic thinking require SES's to be thought of as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
* CAS's are:
  * Multi-agent system
  * Exhibiting self-organisation and adaptation
  * Emergent behaviour
  * Heavily interconnected
  * Exhibits non-linearities
* Current state of the world and the narrative of the poly-crisis
* Global Changes (In no specific order yet, heavily interrelated)
  * Technological changes
  * Economic Changes (Globalization)
  * Environmental change
  * Changing land use and Urbanization 
  * Changes in geopolitical power relations
  * Institutional and Organisational changes
  * The beginning of resource limits
* Climate Change
  * IPCC + SRES
* Changes are coupled and compounding
* Organizational white-waters and the lack of precedent
* Dealing with these changes requires new governance concepts
  * Resilience
  * Complexity can be exploited (give some hope)
  * Adaptive management
  * Fragmented perspectives and Shared understanding
    * Shared understanding between different disciplines and decision makers
  * Role of modelling in creating shared understanding
* Brief history of modelling (some of the below, still have to look into it properly, keep it brief)
  * Differential equations
  * Dynamical Systems models
  * Agent Based models
  * Challenge to modelling has changed (more uncertainty, more complex, "softer" less physical systems)
* Probabilistic graphical models
* Bayesian networks
  * What is a Bayesian network, Bayes rule, CPD's etc.
* Use of Bayesian networks in SES modelling
  * Advantages of Bayesian Networks for SES modelling
  * Short comings of BN's
* Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN)
  * Varieties of DBN's
* Some applications of DBN's in spheres related to SES

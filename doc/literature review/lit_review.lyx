Sustainability can be most clearly described as ensuring intergenerational
 equity (Weiss, 1987), meaning that the actions of this generation do not
 prejudice future generations by depleting resources or degrading the environmen
t that our society depends on, while simultaneously ensuring intra-generational
 equity, the fair and equitable distribution of resources between different
 sections of the same generation.

This concern about sustainability stems from the recent realization of the
 fragility of our environment and society.
 It comes at a period in our history that has seen and is seeing huge changes
 in all aspects of our lives, spurred by the leaps in technology and the
 increasing globalization it has allowed.
 Not only is the world more complex than ever before but at the same time
 the global community faces a polycrisis of multiple interrelated and reinforcin
g crises

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the 1900's the rate of technological progress has been exponentially
 increasing, as have it's effects upon society.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advances in medicine have simultaneously decreased infant mortality and
 increased longevity.
 This has manifested as a rapidly growing population, from 1.65 billion people
 in 1900 to almost 7 billion in 2010 (UN World pop prospects).
 By 2100 it is expected that the global population will reach 10.1 billion,
 although by then it is expected that the population growth rate will have
 dramatically declined to an almost stable level (UN World pop prospects).
 Never the massive increase in population has had dramatic effects upon
 almost every aspect of society and society's impact upon the environment.
 These effects have been compounded by society's changing consumption habits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human industrial activities have correspondingly increased in magnitude.
 Increasing technological prowess has allowed for stratospheric leaps in
 the scope and reach of industry.
 This has had a dramatically positive effect on the quality of life of many
 (first world) citizens.
 However it has also increased expectation and necessity to consume goods.
 This increase in per a capita consumption coupled with the growing population
 has led to a huge increase in the consumption of industrial inputs, such
 as mineral and energy resources.
 Corresponding to the increased consumption of industrial outputs has been
 the increase in industrial waste and pollution, to the point that it is
 now causing global damage to the biosphere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changing form of the economy from what was originally an agricultural
 base to an industrial and service sector base has brought about many changes
 in the geography human settlement.
 Rapid urbanization has occurred with over 50% of the global population
 now living in cities.
 While cities appear to offer an increased variety and quality of services
 in reality many (if not most) urban immigrants are forced to settle in
 the squalor of mushrooming shanty towns that surround most third world
 cities.
 The slow rate of job creation and the inability of urban infrastructure
 to cope with the increased demands of urbanisation leave many exiled from
 the economic system, with no hope of access to even the most basic services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence of new communication and transportation technologies, as
 well as the insatiable desire for resources and goods of the developed
 world economies, industrial corporations have become globe spanning.
 This has connected geographically disparate economies into a dense web
 of shared interests and competing agendas.
 Actions in one area of the world are increasingly being observed to affect
 completely separate sectors in countries on the opposite side of the world
 and geopolitical  spectrum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Globalization is changing, among many things, the geopolitical and economic
 power relationships between and within nations.
 The bipolar power relations of the cold-war era are now a distant memory
 and in its place is a shifting network of power blocks and global agendas.
 Political decisions require more cooperation to be effective with traditionally
 ignored power players making there presence felt with the combined economic
 strength of the developing world, on the back of China, India and Brazil,
 now demanding greater representation in global decision making and policy
 bodies.
 The rapid growth seen in parts of the developing world is placing enormous
 strain on global resources as the huge population blocks of the like of
 India and China are now demanding the lifestyle benefits common in the
 developed world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These changing global dynamics have placed the world into the early stages
 of what could be a polycrisis consisting of multiple interrelated and reinforci
ng crises

 As previously mentioned the ecological impact of global industry is severely
 affecting affecting the biosphere, causing large scale ecosystem destruction
 and global climate change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
15 of the 24 key ecosystem services on which humans depend are degraded
 or are being used unsustainably (United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
, 2005 (from M swilling, UNEP) ).
 These services provide for and support basic necessities such as food productio
n and water supplies.
 The degradation of these services disproportionately affects the poor,
 and especially sub-Saharan Africa (UNMEA).
 Biodiversity, a key component of many ecosystem services, is being dramatically
 reduced by mass extinctions of species caused by the compounding effects
 of climate change and the habitat destruction caused by expanding human
 activities (thomas 2004 (lost)).
 Global ecosystem destruction is coupled with, compounded by, and compounds
 climate change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a committee convened by
 the United Nations to investigate climate change, is unequivocal that a
 large component of the increases in global temperatures are caused anthropogeni
c green house gases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 global warming and rising sea levels would continue for centuries, stating
 quite plainly:

Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries due
 to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks, even
 if GHG (Green house gas) concentrations were to be stabilised.

\begin_layout Standard
Green house gases and the associated climate change affect not global temperatur
es but also: sea levels, rainfall levels, ocean acidity, polar ice shelves
 and wind patterns.
 These changes further compound ecosystem destruction as well as impacting
 upon a myriad of human activities through changes in agricultural conditions,
 human settlement and land use.

Predictions about climate change are heavily contingent on the assumptions
 made about future human activity.
 Because of this the IPCC has developed a number of possible scenarios in

 decisions humanity makes with regard to its political, economic and environment

\begin_layout Standard
The A1 family is defined by a a high level of globalization and homogenization
 of the global economy activity and per capita income.
 Economic growth is rapid due to the introduction of new efficient technologies.
 The increased social interactions and economic growth lead to globally
 converging fertility patterns causing the population to peak around mid-century
 and then decline.
 The A1 family is divided into 3 scenarios dependent on the spread of technologi
es used in energy generation: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy
 sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B).
 The impact of differing technological decisions is especiialy pronounced
 in in these scenarios with the resulting increases in global temperatures
 ranging from a low of 1.4

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The A2 family describes a heavily regionalized and economically heterogeneous
 world.
 The decreased global interaction and cooperation leads to economic and
 fertility patterns not rapidly converging between regions.
 This fragmentation leads to slow economic and technological growth as well
 as a continuously increasing population reaching 13.6

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The B1 storyline describes a similarly globalized world as the A1 world
 but with drastic change in economic emphasis toward service and information
 sectors with corresponding decreases in material intensity, as well the
 large scale introduction clean and efficiency increasing technologies.
 Form these focuses emerge global solutions to economic, social and ecological
 sustainability, in terms of both inter- and intra-generational equity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The B2 storyline envisages a regionalized world much like A2 but with local
 policy makers emphasizing sustainable solutions to socio-economic and ecologica
l problems.
 The result is a continuously increasing population, though at less of a
 rate than A2, and less economic growth and rapid technological development
 than in the A1 and B1 story lines.
 While there are many efforts towards environmental protection they lack
 the global coordination of A2 and are bound by local regions, thus limiting
 their effectiveness.

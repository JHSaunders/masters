This concern about sustainability stems from the recent realization of the
 fragility of our environment and society.
 It comes at a period in our history that has seen and is seeing huge changes
 in all aspects of our lives, spurred by the leaps in technology and the
 increasing globalization it has allowed.
 Not only is the world more complex than ever before but at the same time
 the global community faces a polycrisis of multiple interrelated and reinforcin

 the complexity, interconnectedness and multiplicity of the problems, as
 well as a feeling for how fast things are changing and how we really can
 not rely on precedent.
 I feel this perspective is important in order to understand the various
 trade offs and priority of the modeling techniques.
 However I don't have the time or expertise to give a full history of the

 Some of this stuff would probably move to the introduction when the lit

\begin_layout Standard
Since the 1900's the rate of technological progress has been exponentially
 increasing, as have it's effects upon society.
 Advances in medicine have simultaneously decreased infant mortality and
 increased longevity.
 This has manifested as a rapidly growing population, growing from 1.65 billion
 people in 1900 to almost 7 billion in 2010 (UN World pop prospects).
 By 2100 it is expected that the global population will reach 10.1 billion,
 although by then it is expected that the population growth rate will have
 dramatically declined to an almost stable level (UN World pop prospects).
 The massive increase in population has had dramatic effects upon almost
 every aspect of society and society's impact upon the environment.
 These effects have been compounded by society's changing consumption habits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human industrial activities have correspondingly increased in magnitude.
 Increasing technological prowess has allowed for stratospheric leaps in
 the scope and reach of industry.
 This has had a dramatically positive effect on the quality of life of many,
 first world, citizens.
 However it has also increased expectation and necessity to consume goods.
 This increase in per a capita consumption coupled with the growing population
 has led to a huge increase in the consumption of industrial inputs, such
 as mineral and energy resources.
 Corresponding to the increased consumption of industrial outputs has been
 the increase in industrial waste and pollution, to the point that it is
 now damaging the global biosphere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The movement of the economy from an agricultural base to an industrial and
 services base has altered the patterns of human settlement.
 The population has rapidly urbanised with over 50% of the global population
 now living in cities.
 While cities appear to offer an increased variety and quality of services
 in reality many ,if not most, urban immigrants are forced to settle in
 the squalor of mushrooming shanty towns that surround most third world
 cities.
 The slow rate of job creation and the inability of urban infrastructure
 to cope with the increased demands of urbanisation leave many people exiled
 from the economic system, with no hope of access to even the most basic
 services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence of new communication and transportation technologies, as
 well as the insatiable desire for resources and goods of the developed
 world economies, industrial corporations have become globe spanning.
 Previously disparate economies have been connected into a dense web of
 shared interests and competing agendas.
 Actions in one area of the world are increasingly being observed to affect
 completely separate sectors in countries on the opposite side of the world
 and geopolitical  spectrum.
 These changes in economic relationships have lead geopolitical relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bipolar power relations of the cold-war era are now a distant memory
 and in its place is a shifting network of power blocks and global agendas.
 Political decisions require more cooperation to be effective.
 Traditionally ignored power players are making their presence felt using
 the emerging economic strength of the developing world and are now demanding
 greater representation in global decision making and policy bodies.
 The rapid growth seen in parts of the developing world is placing enormous
 strain on global resources as the huge population blocks of the like of
 India and China are now demanding the lifestyle benefits that are common
 in the developed world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously mentioned the ecological impact of global industry is severely
 affecting affecting the biosphere, causing large scale ecosystem destruction
 and global climate change.
 According to the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (UNMEA), 15 of the
 24 key ecosystem services on which humans depend are degraded or are being
 used unsustainably (United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005
 (from M swilling, UNEP) ).
 These services provide for and support basic necessities such as food productio
n and water supplies.
 The degradation of these services disproportionately affects the poor,
 and especially sub-Saharan Africa (UNMEA).
 Biodiversity, a key component of many ecosystem services, is being dramatically
 reduced by mass extinctions of species caused by the compounding effects
 of climate change and the habitat destruction caused by expanding human
 activities (thomas 2004 (lost)).
 Global ecosystem destruction is coupled with, compounded by, and compounds
 climate change.
 which will be discussed later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coupled effects of ecosystem destruction and climate change are negatively
 impacting global food security.
 Changes in rainfall and regional temperatures (Check Economist Article
 sources), as well as damaged soil nutrient ecosystems (UNMEA) have reduced
 crop yields.
 This has been especially prevalent in the developing world areas that heavily
 rely on subsistence farming, such as Sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Brown2008,Bloem2010"

\end_inset

.
 Consequentially staple food prices have risen globally, causing political
 instability in some countries, such as the food riots in Indonesia in 2008.
 Some smaller yet wealthier nations have gone so far as to purchase massive
 tracts of arable land in poorer nations, causing widespread protest in
 those nations (Madagascar ref?) and further reducing their food security.
 Water scarcity compounds food insecurity by affecting the reliability of
 irrigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increases in water demand and increased per capita use have placed global
 water resources under great stress.
 Over one in six people do not have access to safe drinking water (ref?),
 demand far outstrips current supplies, and many of the current urban supplies
 come from fresh water aquifers that are being depleted far faster than
 they are begin renewed (ref?).
 Water presents a particularly complex managerial problem as it involves
 many different types of stakeholders and often water resources cross institutio
nal and national boundaries.

Anthropogenic climate change

 the United Nations to investigate climate change, is unequivocal that a

Green house gases and the associated climate change affect not global temperatur

 and wind patterns.
 These changes further compound ecosystem destruction as well as impacting
 upon a myriad of human activities through changes in agricultural conditions,
 human settlement and land use.

\begin_layout Standard
The A1 family is defined by a a high level of globalization and homogenization
 of the global economy activity and per capita income.
 Economic growth is rapid due to the introduction of new efficient technologies.
 The increased social interactions and economic growth lead to globally
 converging fertility patterns causing the population to peak around mid-century
 and then decline.
 The A1 family is divided into 3 scenarios dependent on the spread of technologi
es used in energy generation: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy
 sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B).
 The impact of differing technological decisions is especially pronounced
 in in these scenarios with the resulting increases in global temperatures
 ranging from a low of 1.4
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$

 in A1T to 6.4
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$

 in A1FI.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The A2 family describes a heavily regionalized and economically heterogeneous
 world.
 The decreased global interaction and cooperation leads to economic and
 fertility patterns not rapidly converging between regions.
 This fragmentation leads to slow economic and technological growth as well
 as a continuously increasing population reaching 13.6

\begin_layout Standard
The B1 storyline describes a similarly globalized world as the A1 world
 but with drastic change in economic emphasis toward service and information
 sectors with corresponding decreases in material intensity, as well the
 large scale introduction clean and efficiency increasing technologies.
 Form these focuses emerge global solutions to economic, social and ecological
 sustainability, in terms of both inter- and intra-generational equity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The B2 storyline envisages a regionalized world much like A2 but with local
 policy makers emphasizing sustainable solutions to socio-economic and ecologica
l problems.
 The result is a continuously increasing population, though at less of a
 rate than A2, and less economic growth and rapid technological development
 than in the A1 and B1 story lines.
 While there are many efforts towards environmental protection they lack
 the global coordination of A2 and are bound by local regions, thus limiting
 their effectiveness.

 one aspect capable of influencing many other aspects and factors.
 The multivariate and interconnected nature of the social-ecological system

New approaches to governance 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inherent complexity of social-ecological systems breeds a large degree
 of uncertainty, both because of a natural propensity of social-ecological
 systems to contain random or chaotic events and, more importantly, due
 to out limited and incomplete understanding of the system (ref?) .
 Incomplete understanding is inevitable given the scope of the social-ecological
 systems and the rapidity with which the system dynamics can change.
 Traditional management and governance techniques are ill-suited to dealing
 with this uncertainty and complexity (ref?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally management has dealt with problem in terms of a predictive
 relationship between a small number of variables, dealing with each in
 isolation, or relative isolation, optimising some desired value or property
 with respect to the small set of inputs.
 This methodology is based upon a number of severely mistaken assumptions,
 namely that : problems can be dealt with in isolation from the larger containin
g system; the relationships between system variables are static and predictable;
 there is only one possible future that we need concern ourselves with;
 and that management has a complete understanding of the relevant situation
 (ref?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Responding to the failure of traditional management in the dealing with
 social-ecological issues, practitioners and researchers have developed
 alternative techniques and perspectives to deal with complex social-ecological
 systems.
 Rather than denying management uncertainty and system complexity they make
 them central to their management ideology.
 Chief among these are

\begin_layout Standard
Resilience is a perspective that moves the management objective from optimisatio

\begin_inset Quotes eld

adaptive capacity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a system.
 Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to absorb changes while still
 maintaining the same controls over function and structure 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Holling1973"

\end_inset

.
 This is deeply intertwined with the system's ability to self-organise and
 its capacity to retain knowledge from experience.
 A system with a low adaptive capacity is vulnerable to small disturbances,
 potentially irreversibly causing it to settle into new stable state where
 it does not provide the ecosystem services it previously did (resalliance
 ref?).
 In highly uncertain systems it is important that the system can maintain
 its current functions no matter which of the multiplicity of futures manifests
 itself (UNEP ref?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Complexity is not without its benefits however, within complex systems it
 is possible o finds leverage points where small interventions can have
 profound positive effects.
 Similarly intelligent resource allocation and balancing can be used to
 achieve desired goals without having to increase system resource usage
 (swilling,decoupling paper ref?).
 This is possible due to the inherent non-linearity of complex adaptive
 systems.

 For simplicity of notation we will use upper case letters to denote Variables
 and the associated lower case for states when appropriate, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 for a variable and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for a state of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 The states are given probabilities as to the likely hood of the variable
 being in that state, so each state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is assigned a 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X=x)$
\end_inset

 In cases where continuous data must be dealt with it is normally discretised
 or an extension to the Bayesian network structure is used, which will be
 discussed later.

 This structure means that if

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{n}$

 is conditionally independent of

The probabilities of the states in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{n}$
\end_inset

 are related to the probabilities of the parent's states through a conditional
 probability distribution (CPD).
 In the canonical form this takes the form of a conditional probability
 table (CPT).
 This CPT maps combinations of a variables' parent variables' states to
 probabilities of the variables' states being true.
 formally it is a function that maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\times_{i\{V_{i}\in I_{n}\}}S_{i}\rightarrow P(V_{n}=x)$

\begin_layout Subsection
Bayesian Inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of calculating the state of each variable is known as inference.
 When the each variable is calculated in forward manner, i.e.
 with it's parent's states already having been calculated, this is known
 as deductive inference.
 One of the strengths of Bayesian networks is that it can also perform the
 reverse, it can infer the state of parents based on their children's states,
 this is known as diagnostic inference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept behind diagnostic inference is natural, though difficult to
 do intuitively (Reference from great psych paper I can't think of for this,
 really funny).

 You go out one day and notice the grass is wet.
 Your options are that either the neighbours had the sprinkler on or that
 it had rained.
 However you notice that it is a very sunny day.
 From that information you can infer that the sprinklers were indeed on.
 You can diagnose the cause of an event based on the effects.
 The statistical relationship that this works on is Bayes rule.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 relates the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

\end_inset

 and the conditional probability

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This relationship allows for Bayesian inference to be done when any evidence
 is set.
 Evidence is an assignment of the state of a variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(V_{n}=x)$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in S_{n}$

 Given the evidence the rest of the variables' state's can be inferred.

\begin_layout Standard
Strategies for Bayesian inference fall into two main groups, exact and approxima
te inference.
 Both exact and approximate inference are NP-hard (Refs?), the computational
 effort required to do the inference increases exponentially with the amount
 of variables and ,specifically, states in the variables

\begin_layout Standard
Approximate methods approximate the solution to the Bayesian inference problem.
 Increasing the accuracy of the approximation exponentially increases the
 required computational effort.
 Approximation techniques work off a sampling system, where many samples
 of the Bayesian networks states are taken, and the aggregate is used to
 assign probabilities.
 Due to this the computational effort required to improve the accuracy of
 the approximation increases dramatically (ref?).
 Most approximate inference techniques work off an MCMC system.
 Techniques using Gibbs samplers (ref?) are popular, as well as likelihood
 weighting (ref?) and loopy belief propagation(ref?) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In practice approximate techniques are faster than exact techniques, especially
 in cases where the network is too large to feasibly calculate an exact
 solution.
 The disadvantage is that approximate techniques struggle to accurately
 reconstruct the full probability distribution for complex variables with
 many states.
 They are more suited to case where the variables are simple or where only
 aggregated statistics about the probability mass is required, such as mean
 or variance (ref? if I can find one).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extended and alternative Bayesian networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian network structure has been extended and generalised.
 Most extensions relate to the structure of the variables and the associated
 CPDs.
 The motivation for these extensions is most often that they allow for a
 more natural and computationally efficient representation of continuous
 variables than the classic discrete variables do.
 In general they work by assuming a certain structure for the underlying
 probability distribution of a variable, and then parameterising that.
 Gaussian Bayesian networks (also called Gaussian networks) (ref?) assume
 that the variables have an underlying Gaussian distribution, which is parameter
ised by the mean and variance.
 The CPD takes the form of a covariance matrix.
 Gaussian and discrete nodes can be both be used in the same network, with
 the restriction that Gaussian nodes cannot have discrete parents (ref?).
 Gaussian networks have been extended to Conditional Gaussian networks which
 allow discrete variables to act as switches between Gaussian distributions

\begin_layout Standard
If the graph structure of the network is known before hand then learning
 is significantly simpler.
 In the case where a complete set of data is available where the value of
 each variable is known for each data point the process of learning becomes
 almost trivial, for each data point and each variable the corresponding
 entry in the conditional probability table, based on the variable and it's
 parents states, is incremented.
 finally the CPTs are normalised (ref?).
 Though this is essentially a frequentist interpretation of the data, and
 Bayesian networks are ,obviously, Bayesian in nature it does not cause
 any practical statistical contradictions

\begin_layout Standard
In the case where the data is incomplete, in that there are data points
 where variables do not have a value assigned, the task is only slightly
 more difficult.
 In this case an expectation maximisation style algorithm can be used.
 The algorithm proceeds as before, except that when a variable does not
 have a a value assigned Bayesian inference is performed on the existing
 network to generate a value (ref?).

\begin_layout Standard
Learning Bayesian networks with unknown graph structure is more complicated
 and significantly more computationally intensive.
 The basic outline of the system is to generate graph structures in some
 way (generally using some sort of randomized hill climbing algorithm) and
 then populate the CPT via the previously mentioned methods and then score
 them in some way, generally by using a portion of the known data that was
 not used in the training as a verification dataset (ref? check swazi paper).
 This is commonly called a search-and-score system (ref? Banjo paper).
 The possible solution space for graph structures is huge, it increases
 exponentially with the number of variables.
 As such the solution will most likely not be globally optimal, and largely
 depends on the quality of the graph generation routine.

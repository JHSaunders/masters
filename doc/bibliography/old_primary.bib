  abstract = {The global food supply system is facing serious new challenges from
	economic and related crises and climate change, which directly affect
	the nutritional well-being of the poor by reducing their access to
	nutritious food. To cope, vulnerable populations prioritize consumption
	of calorie-rich but nutrient-poor food. Consequently, dietary quality
	and eventually quantity decline, increasing micronutrient malnutrition
	(or hidden hunger) and exacerbating preexisting vulnerabilities that
	lead to poorer health, lower incomes, and reduced physical and intellectual
	capabilities. This article introduces the series of papers in this
	supplement, which explore the relationships between crises and their
	cumulative impacts among vulnerable populations, particularly through
	hidden hunger.},

  title = {An evolutionary Bayesian belief network methodology for optimum management
	of groundwater contamination},
  journal = {Environmental Modelling \& Software},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {24},
  pages = {303 - 310},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {An integrated methodology, based on Bayesian belief network (BBN)
	and evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), is proposed
	for combining available evidence to help water managers evaluate
	implications, including costs and benefits of alternative actions,
	and suggest best decision pathways under uncertainty. A Bayesian
	belief network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents
	a set of variables and their probabilistic relationships, which also
	captures historical information about these dependencies. In complex
	applications where the task of defining the network could be difficult,
	the proposed methodology can be used in validation of the network
	structure and the parameters of the probabilistic relationship. Furthermore,
	in decision problems where it is difficult to choose appropriate
	combinations of interventions, the states of key variables under
	the full range of management options cannot be analyzed using a Bayesian
	belief network alone as a decision support tool. The proposed optimization
	method is used to deal with complexity in learning about actions
	and probabilities and also to perform inference. The optimization
	algorithm generates the state variable values which are fed into
	the Bayesian belief network. It is possible then to calculate the
	probabilities for all nodes in the network (belief propagation).
	Once the probabilities of all the linked nodes have been updated,
	the objective function values are returned to the optimization tool
	and the process is repeated. The proposed integrated methodology
	can help in dealing with uncertainties in decision making pertaining
	to human behavior. It also eliminates the shortcoming of Bayesian
	belief networks in introducing boundary constraints on probability
	of state values of the variables. The effectiveness of the proposed
	methodology is examined in optimum management of groundwater contamination
	risks for a well field capture zone outside Copenhagen city.},

  pages = {1025 - 1036},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {A broad range of tools are available for integrated water resource
	management (IWRM). In the EU research project NeWater, a hypothesis
	exists that IWRM cannot be realised unless current management regimes
	undergo a transition toward adaptive management (AM). This includes
	a structured process of learning, dealing with complexity, uncertainty
	etc. We assume that it is no longer enough for managers and tool
	researchers to understand the complexity and uncertainty of the outer
	natural system--the environment. It is just as important, to understand
	what goes on in the complex and uncertain participatory processes
	between the water managers, different stakeholders, authorities and
	researchers when a specific tool and process is used for environmental
	management. The paper revisits a case study carried out 2001-2004
	where the tool Bayesian networks (BNs) was tested for groundwater
	management with full stakeholder involvement. With the participation
	of two researchers (the authors) and two water managers previously
	involved in the case study, a qualitative interview was prepared
	and carried out in June 2006. The aim of this ex-post evaluation
	was to capture and explore the water managers' experience with Bayesian
	belief networks when used for integrated and adaptive water management
	and provide a narrative approach for tool enhancement.},
